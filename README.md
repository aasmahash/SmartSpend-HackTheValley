## 💡 Inspiration

As young adults entering university, many of us realized how little we actually knew about managing our personal finances. Navigating expenses like rent, food, and social activities without a clear picture of where our money was going often led to overspending or overthinking every purchase.

We wanted a simple way to visualize our spending habits, understand where we could cut back, and see how our choices today could affect our finances in the future.

That’s why we created **SmartSpend** — a tool designed to help students gain financial awareness and make smarter spending decisions.

## 🧠 What It Does

**SmartSpend** helps students make sense of their finances in a simple, secure way.

Users can:

* Create an account and upload **bank statements** (with no sensitive information).
* View a **clear summary** of monthly spending patterns.
* Receive **projections of future expenses** based on their spending habits.

The app turns raw transaction data into **easy-to-read dashboards** and **actionable insights** to help students plan ahead with confidence.

* Stored user accounts and transaction data securely in a **cloud-based database**.
* Processed data using **Pandas** and generated one-year forecasts using **Meta Prophet**.
* Exported processed data as **JSON** for real-time integration with the Flutter dashboard.
* Designed and prototyped the UI in **Figma**, then refined it through iterative testing in Flutter.
